Emaletter is a Haskell application designed to create newsletter for any technology stack.

Repo structure is documented in ./README.md. Read it.

To build the project, you can run `cabal build all` in the Nix devShell. The VSCode terminal is often activated in direnv, so `nix develop -c` is usually not required.

## Haskell coding guidelines

- Library preferences
    - We use relude as prelude
    - Prefer optics over lens
    - Use NeatInterpolation for multiline strings.
- Imports
    - Prefer qualified imports unless it impacts readability.
    - Use explicit imports unless it makes sense (as with preludes, or when importing optparse-applicative in a CLI module)
- Modules
    - Generally most modules should have explicit exports, unless it makes sense otherwise (e.g.: when all toplevels need to be exported, as is the case with Widgets.hs for instance)

## Design

- Use Tailwind for CSS styling (tailwind.css is auto-generated by a process automatically; don't worry about it; just modify the Haskell code)
- Use Widgets.hs for put common UI elements; document each of them as Haddock comment (brief)
- App layout: one heading bar (with logo, breadcrumbs, title, ...) and the main body below, followed by footer. It is simple, but also colourful.
- Font: a pretty font from Google Fonts.
